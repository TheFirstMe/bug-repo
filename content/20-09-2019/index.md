A technical talk was conducted as a part of IEEE spectrum talk series on 20<sup>th</sup> September 2019 at S1 ECA. The talk was delivered by Vismaya Sunil, Chairperson ISTE GCE Kannur, on the topic “Is there an end to Moore’s Law? ”. The talk began at 1.15 PM. She talked about Moore's law, the law that actually matters in technology, which has made significant contributions in the field of architecture and the software. Both physical challenges and the lack of demand for smaller transistors has led to the end of Moore’s law but still, technologists are finding ways to bring back the law because they want it to be true.

There were many doubts regarding this topic and all those were cleared by her. The talk was really a nice one and ended by around 1.45 PM.

Thejaswi A G from S5 CSE delivered the vote of thanks.
