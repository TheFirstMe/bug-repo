An online coding workshop was conducted by IEEE WIE as a part of WIE Week on 23<sup>rd</sup> March at EEE software lab, Govt. College of Engineering, Kannur. The workshop started at sharp 9:30 AM. There were almost 20 students. The resource person for the session was Muhammad Irfan. This workshop was mainly focussed for the beginners where students were able to start from zero and learn the fundamentals of coding languages like HTML, C and PYTHON. He took the class in a very interesting manner and was a really enjoyable one.

After lunch, a healthy coding competition was conducted in order to evaluate what they learnt from the workshop. Merlitta Jose and Prajul won the competition and they were appreciated. 

The workshop ended around 3 PM. P Akshaya proposed the vote of thanks.
